Inspired by [Joel's blog on Snake Puzzle Games](https://joelthefox.github.io/2019-08-21-Snake-Puzzle-Games/), an encyclopedic collection
of all things snake-puzzle-related, I'm starting a blog for time travel games. Time travel is a Pandora's box of paradoxes; each author
must choose how to solve or sidestep them. Each set of choices leads to a different model of Time; each model has its own interesting
consequences, and it's my belief that puzzle games are the best way to explore them.

My main goal with this blog is to properly categorize all the different flavors of time travel and how they are used in puzzles. 
[I also recommend this other blog which does the same, for general fiction](https://qntm.org/models).
This blog will try to be an exhaustive list of all these flavors, but it won't try to be an exhaustive list of time travel puzzle games
(or creating & maintaining it would be a full time job). In no particular order, these are all the unique models I've found so far:

{% capture time_genre_names %}
glorified-undo
spicy-undo
serialism
closed-timelike-curve
standard
record-clones
fake-causal-loop
past-and-future
tenet
multiverse-time-travel
linear-time
slow-down-time
2d-time
{% endcapture %}
{% assign time_genre_names = time_genre_names | strip | newline_to_br | strip_newlines | split: "<br />" %}

{% assign done_time_genres = "" | split: ',' %}
{% assign pending_time_genres = site.time_genres %}
{% for cur_name in time_genre_names %}
  {% assign cur_url = cur_name | prepend: "/time-genres/" | append: "/" %}
  {% assign cur_time_genre = site.time_genres | where: "url", cur_url | first %}
  {% assign done_time_genres = done_time_genres | push: cur_time_genre %}
  {% assign pending_time_genres = pending_time_genres | where_exp: "item", "item.url != cur_url" %}
{% endfor %}

{% for time_genre in done_time_genres %}
  - [{{ time_genre.title}}]({{ time_genre.url }}) - {{ time_genre.subtitle }}
{%- endfor -%}

{% for time_genre in pending_time_genres %}
  - (WIP) [{{ time_genre.title}}]({{ time_genre.url }}) - {{ time_genre.subtitle }}
{%- endfor -%} <!-- -->
